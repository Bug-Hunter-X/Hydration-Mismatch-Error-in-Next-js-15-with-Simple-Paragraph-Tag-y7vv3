This repository demonstrates a hydration mismatch error encountered in Next.js 15 when a simple paragraph tag is used within a div element. The issue occurs during the client-side hydration process, causing the application to render incorrectly. The solution involves ensuring that the server-side rendering and client-side hydration match perfectly.  This example illustrates the error and the solution for this specific scenario.
